Shipping:

Orders will go out no later than 48 hours after receipt of payment. Tracking info will be provided, unless there is anything illegal shipped to you or prohibited by state law for shipping. Packages of that nature will be sent very discreetly and carefully, and I’ll be able to provide ballpark ETAs for those. 

Verification:

To order, send payment confirmation and drop address in a self-destructing note via 

https://1ty.me

As soon as I get it and confirm, I’ll let you know and provide tracking / ETA if applicable. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE - your drop address is a real physical location, no abandoned lots or fake addresses in a field. Make sure someone lives there and it’s addressed to them. Please do not share my return address with anyone ever. As soon as we have a smooth transaction with one another I’ll pin vouches in another post. 

Proceeds from these kits are going to a mutual aid group that will help get medication to HIV+ folks, and also the medication that cures Hepatitis-C. Your order literally helps save lives, and we always want you to be safe with yours! 

If you find out you are running out of rigs faster than you thought you would, send me a message and I can probably send out a couple more bags to tide you over until your next order. I’m a harm reductionist at heart, a drug user through and through, and I just want everyone to have the safest, most enjoyable experience possible. Thanks for checking us out. Hit me up with any questions!
